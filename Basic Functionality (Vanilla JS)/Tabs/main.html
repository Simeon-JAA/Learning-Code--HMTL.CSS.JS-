        <p>This is what we use to make websites. Why don't you right-click & inspect this webpage to vue the html code. Nothing special but i am still proud to build this from scratch :)
          <br><br> Making this, i am not using frameworks or libraries and my html code for bigger projects is longer than the walk on the red carpet :( Im hoping to install react later today and start some work with frameworks to make my life easier.

        <p>CSS is the cherry on top of the icing. Accompanying the HTML code, the CSS is the reason why this tabs project is arranged well with a colour scheme etc. 
          Coding vanilla :( the CSS looks great on a desktop and when moved to a smaller device such as a phone, will start to mess up.
          <br> <br> This can be fixed with media queries, however this is very extensive and long. Bootstrapping will solve this problem which i will look into in the near future.

        <p>Javascript is the functionality of the application. This tabs project works by adding a click event to the buttons above.
          <br> <br> Once clicked, the active class is removed from all sections and buttons, and applied to the one that was clicked on.
          The button and section are 'linked together' using a dataset id  & id.
